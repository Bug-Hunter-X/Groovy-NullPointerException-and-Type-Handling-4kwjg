This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to null pointer exceptions and type handling. Groovy's flexible typing system can mask potential issues if not handled carefully. The `bug.groovy` file shows how passing null or an unexpected type to a method can lead to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a solution to handle these scenarios gracefully.
